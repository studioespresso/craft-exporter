# Usage
Element exporter can be set up in a number of ways, 

## Creating an export

### Step 1: Element selection
On the first step, you start by selecting the type of Element you want to export. If the element is question has groups (and possibly subgroups), you have to select on of these as well.

These element types and groups are supported out of the box:
- Entry (grouped by Secions and Entry Types) <Badge type="info" text="4.0.0" />
- Categories (grouped by Category groups) <Badge type="info" text="4.0.0" />
- Formie submissions (groups by Form) <Badge type="info" text="4.0.0" />

If the element can be localized, you also have to select the site from which you want to export items. 

### Step 2: Field selection
On the next step, you'll select which attributes &  fields you want to be included in the export.


### Step 3: Delivery settings
